## Installation

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-create-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv .venv  # Using .venv for clarity
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Application:**

   Run the backend and frontend concurrently in separate terminal windows:

   **Backend:** (from `backend` directory)

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

   **Frontend:** (from `frontend` directory)

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```


### Docker Setup

1.  Navigate to the project root directory.
2.  Run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will build and start both the frontend and backend containers.
